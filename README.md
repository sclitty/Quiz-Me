# Quiz-Me 
Making an online quiz using JavaScript and Bootstrap for some style!

The quiz is a potential start to a Flight-Training application for student pilots or current pilots who want to get back to the basics.
The focus material is on Aeronautical-Decision-Making (ADM). Pre-flight risk assessment and mitigation practices. 

You must select the correct answer to proceed to the next question. It's more of a teaching tool that provides immediate feedback. In the future I would like to continue working on making an app that holds multiple learning tools and provides resources based on incorrect answers.

Scoring - 
    The quiz is a timed test of your knowledge on Aeronautical Decision Making. Scored based on time remaining and wrong answers take a time penalty. As you progress the time penalty get more severe for each wrong answer selected. It's nbt a bug, it's a feature! ... :\

Restart Button -
    Needs attention. Currently brings you back to the last question, not restarting the quiz.
